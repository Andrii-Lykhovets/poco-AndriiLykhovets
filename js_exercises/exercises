Ex. 3.1.1 (*) - Print greeting
initialize MAX_LENGTH_OF_NAME 20
1. there is a variable NAME
2. prompt "Please enter your name."
3. Store user input in variable NAME
    3/1 Trim spaces from beginning and end of NAME
4. Take the length of NAME and store it in COUNT
    if COUNT is more than 50
    display "entered name is too long"
    go back to step 2
    else
5. If COUNT is = to 0, go back to step 2
6. Display "Hello, " + NAME + "."

Output: > Hello, .


Ex. 3.1.2 (*) - Add numbers
there are 2 variables
prompt "Enter a number"
prompt "Enter a number"
transform string inputs into numbers
store input in variables
result = n1 + n2
print the result


Ex. 3.1.3 (*) - Which number is bigger?
Declare 2 variables, both numbers. Compare which number is greater Log the output, e.g. "The greater number
of 5 and 10 is 10." Add an output for the else statement, e.g. "The smaller number of 5 and 10 is 5."

1. Introduce variables
a = 10
b = 5

2. Create a function that compares the numbers and prompts the result
compare_numbers_function(number_1, number_2):
    if number_1 > number_2:
        print("The greater number of number_1 and number_2 is number_1")
    else:
        print("The smaller number of number_1 and number_2 is number_2.")

3. Call the function
compare_numbers_function(a, b)


Ex. 3.1.4 (*) - Subtract numbers ca. 45 min
Allow the user to input numbers, subtract the smaller from the bigger number and print the result.

1. Introduce variables through input
a = int(input("Input a number"))
b = int(input("Input a number"))

2. Create a function that compares the numbers, performs subtraction and prompts the result
compare_numbers_function(number_1, number_2):
    if number_1 > number_2:
        print(number_1 - number_2)
    else:
        print(number_2 - number_1)

3. Call the function
compare_numbers_function(a, b)

Ex. 3.1.5 (*) - Combine
Combine Ex. 3.1.2 and 3.1.4 into one program.
The program should ask the user if they want to add or subtract two numbers. Then the program should ask
for the two numbers and print the result.

1. Introduce variables
action = input("Do you want to add or subtract two numbers?")

2. Introduce more variables
a = input("Input the 1st number")
b = input("Input the 2nd number")

3. Define a function
perform_action_function(number_1, number_2):
    if action = "add":
        result = number_1 + number_2
        print(result)
    elif action = "subtract":
        result = number_2 - number_1
        print(result)

4  Call the function
perform_action_function(number_1, number_2)



3.2 Intermediate Exercises

! Ex. 3.2.1 (**) - FizzBuzz
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the
number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print
"FizzBuzz".

1. Generate a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, ... 100]
2. Iterate through the list and output "Fizz" for multiples of three or "Buzz" for the multiples of five
for multiple in numbers:
    if multiple % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif multiple % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")
    elif multiple % 3 and 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
